# BlackJackWithArrays

This activity will be completed in lecture in a group of 3 students, you will get points by working with your group on this activity.

As a group download and run the following BlackJack game Java code on this Good Drive as a Java fileLinks to an external site., talk about as a group how the code is working.

You have a few options to run this code together:

You can Fork this replit repositoryLinks to an external site. and share easily with your group for real-time collaboration by inviting members to collaborate on the repo - but after a while you will start being charged.
You can have a Java IDE like Eclipse running on your desktop and run the code given above on the desktop computer in a working Java project.  You would then share your code on the desktop computer in real time.
You can make a clone of this github classroom assignment, and then open this repo in Code Spaces, an online Java IDE.  Using the plugin called LiveShare you can share your code with your group members in real time.
First choose which way you will open and share your code.

Choose one of the enhancements listed below and work as a group to implement this functionality:

* Multiple Rounds: Modify the code to allow the player to play multiple rounds, keeping track of wins, losses, and ties.
* Betting System: Implement a betting system where the player starts with a certain amount of money and can bet on each hand.
* Splitting Pairs: If the player's initial two cards are a pair, allow the option to split into two hands.
* Doubling Down: Allow the player to double their bet after receiving the first two cards, in exchange for committing to stand after receiving exactly one more card.
* Insurance: If the dealer's face-up card is an Ace, offer the player insurance.
* Customizable Deck: Allow the player to choose how many decks they want to play with. This will require modifying the deck initialization and shuffling logic.
* Handling Aces: Modify the code to handle Aces properly, where they can be worth 1 or 11 points. The value should be chosen to benefit the player or dealer.
* Graphical User Interface (GUI): Implement a simple GUI using Swing or JavaFX to make the game more visually appealing.
* Save and Load Game State: Implement functionality to save the game state to a file and load it later.
* Computer Strategy: Implement different strategies for the computer dealer, allowing the player to choose the difficulty level.
* Player Statistics: Keep track of various statistics for the player, such as the number of BlackJacks, busts, etc., and display them at the end of the game or upon request.
* Multiplayer Option: Extend the game to allow multiple human players to play against the dealer.
* Unit Testing: Write unit tests for different parts of the code to ensure that everything is working as expected.
* Internationalization: Allow the game to be played in different languages by implementing internationalization (i18n) support.
* Accessibility Features: Implement features that make the game accessible to players with disabilities, such as text-to-speech or high-contrast display modes.
You will need to follow the roles given in class and work as a group on this assignment for credit. Groups will be made during class time.

Every person from your group will turn in the code, with all of your names at the top of the code as comments.  

Write comments in the code with your name where you add code to the shared Java code file you are to turn in for this assignment.

Turn this code into this assignment in canvas as just the java file that has the modified code and your comments in the code.  This can be the same for everyone in the group, but everyone needs to turn in the file themselves.
